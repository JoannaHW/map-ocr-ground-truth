# map-ocr-ground-truth
The historical Ordinance Survey maps were retrieved from National Library of Scotland (http://maps.nls.uk). The US historical maps were retrieved from Dr. Jerod Weinman's map processing project at Grinnell Coledge (http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~weinman/research/maps.shtml), which were originally archived in the David Rumsey Map Collection (http://www.davidrumsey.com).

In this repository, the ground truth of map labels were created by the USC Spatial Computing Lab (http://spatial-computing.github.io) (licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0), including effort from Yao-Yi Chiang, Narges Honarvar Nazari, Zexuan Luo, Rashmina Ramachandran Menon, Tian Xiang Tan, and Sima Moghaddam.
