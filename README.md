# map-ocr-ground-truth
The historical Ordinance Survey maps were retrieved from National Library of Scotland (<http://maps.nls.uk>). The US historical maps were retrieved from Dr. Jerod Weinman's map processing project at Grinnell Coledge (<http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~weinman/research/maps.shtml>), which were originally archived in the David Rumsey Map Collection (<http://www.davidrumsey.com>).

In this repository, the ground truth of map labels were created by the USC Spatial Computing Lab (<http://spatial-computing.github.io>) (licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0), including effort from Yao-Yi Chiang, Narges Honarvar Nazari, Zexuan Luo, Rashmina Ramachandran Menon, Tian Xiang Tan, and Sima Moghaddam.
